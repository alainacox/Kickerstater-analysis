# Kickstarting with Excel

## Analysis the data to and explain why the kickstarter campaigns succeed, or failed.

### To help Louise with her project camaign

## I analyzed several factors:
-average donations
-launch dates
-percentaged funded
-category
-plegde and goal amounts

### The analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  If we look at the data as a whole more campaigns were more likely to be successful in May. But if launched at the beginning or the end of the year they were more likely to fail. If you look at the campaigns by year you will notice that the data changes. For example if you launched your campaign in 2009 you were more likely to me successful at the ended of the year. Were as in 2013 more campaigns were more likely to succeed at the beginning of the year.

### The analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  The campaigns that had a goal set between $1000 to $4999 had a 73% successful rate. But campaigns that had a goal set at $20000 to $34999 had a higher failed rate when it came to plays. Now, even with the plays goal none of them were canceled the either succeed or failed. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  The challenges were finding the formulas the goals and creating the tables and charts making sure the fields were filtered right and the data set that was being used was correct. 
  The difficulties was the Outcomes based on Goal sheet finding and using the countifs formula. Even with the video and examples it was still harder than expected, because each line had a different formuala it was no dragging and it filling in.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-One conclusion that i can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date is that no matter what subcategory you are campaigning for you will be more likey to succeed if you launch in May. The second conclusion that I have drawn is that there was more theater campaigns that was successful. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I can concluded from the Outcomes based on Goal campaigns with a high goal set is more likely to fail if not fully funded and the goal set plays a bug factor on succeeding and failing.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations of the date is that we the data is from campaigns in different countries and the currency that has a higher exchange rate.
Some campaigns were launched at different time and could of been successful if launched in a different year.
None of the the same campaigns were launched in different countries to see if there would of been a different outcome.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Outcomes based on Deadline
Outcomes based on staff_pick
Outcomes based on Number_of_backers
Outcomes based on Currency
